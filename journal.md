We engaged in a cad session and like had fun we did two versions, not much to say about it we just like watched videos and stuff and then decided to design it, initially we were gonna do a horizontal spinner (V1)

we had some issues with battery and electronic placement, and we werent loving the design all that much so we swtiched to a vertical spinner, the robot is actually pretty different, and i (gabe) dont think that v2 is a direct succesor to v1 as v2 is a totally different robot ngl. 
mason saw some cool stuff with like a tpu robot i think, he can ammend this if he wants to link it, but he added in a tpu impact absorber on the sides. robot kinda looks like a heatsink now but it (should) hold up

i think we gonna need to prototype a little more like once we have the stuff in our hands, as theres only so much you can do with cad

the wheels are also pretty cool there gonna have lika  petg hub for mounting and the actual wheel will be tpu

We are aiming to compete pretty late actually (july-august) but we gonna get a working product out like by early june probably
