bored side quest for two stem scholars



Why?  Ksgat and I belong to an frc team but don't get enough hands on with all aspects of the robot.  We decided to take matters into our own hands and design, build, and compete our own robot.  We went with combat robotics because it is a relatively cheap event and is an easy beginner competition.  So far, 8 hours have been put into CAD, and we project assembly to take 10 hours.
